      Welcome to our little fun game that is so familiar to all of us.
      Even though the rule is simple, some can spend serveral minutes to finish just one round.
      <br />
      <br />
      And every of your move can vary like crazy to prove your victory.
      <br />
      <br />
      This game is powered by ReactJS, CSS,
      and Redux tookit for managing every state throughout the game.
      <br />
      <br />
      The move you and your partner take can be tracked
      by the turn board showing who is going to throw the pucnch first.
      <br />
      <br />
      We also offer you the ability to custom your preferred board size based on your mood.
      <br />
